Dataset with missingness, the data has been cleaned and are ready to use. I attached a notebook where I analysis the New York car crash dataset to study the geometry of the structure missingness (data download via the notebook). I also attached the data for the small size datasets (denoted by a *)
\begin{itemize}
    \item New York car crash
    \item Migration incidents (*)
    \item Netflix film rates
    \item Beer
