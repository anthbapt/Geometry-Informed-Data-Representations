# Geometry-Informed-Data-Representations

Turing Challenge 2024: Geometry-Informed-Data-Representations

Alessandro Barp, Anthony Baptista, and Andrea Marinoni

We attached a notebook (Data_missingness_Geometry.ipynb) where we analysis a dataset with missingness (New York car crash) to study its geometry. 
This notebook include missingness patterns structure analysis, graph filtration based on matrix transformation. The differential geometric tools are available in the following Github: 
https://github.com/anthbapt/pynetflow

You can also download the following toy datasets:
* Migration incidents
* Netflix film rates
* Beer
* Wine

In this OSF repository: https://osf.io/bqcjp/

The real datasets are accessible to the following links:
* Climate change: https://github.com/IMPACTSquad/InterGraphNorwayMM
