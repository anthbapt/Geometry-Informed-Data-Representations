# Geometry-Informed-Data-Representations

Turing Challenge 2024: [Geometry-Informed-Data-Representations](https://www.turing.ac.uk/sites/default/files/2024-01/alessandro_barp-_geometry-informed_data_representations.pdf)

Alessandro Barp, Anthony Baptista, and Andrea Marinoni

We attached a notebook (Data_missingness_Geometry.ipynb) where we analysis a dataset with missingness (New York car crash) to study its geometry. 
This notebook include missingness patterns structure analysis, graph filtration based on matrix transformation. The differential geometric tools are available in the following Github:

The following toy datasets are accessible in the OSF of the Challenge:
* Migration incidents
* Netflix film rates
* Beer
* Wine
